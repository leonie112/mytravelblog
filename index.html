				<h3>Roma🇮🇹</h3>
				<p> Rome is a beautiful city. Yon can't miss it ! There aren't only museums to do every day, it's an attractive city at all levels. At Cantina E Cucina, you can taste the best pasta in the city and even in the world. ;) I really enjoyed walking the cobblestone streets of this capital city, you can really feel the latin country and i love the atmosphere. I also love art so a city full of culture like Rome was a must-see destination where i could very well return. </p>

			<p> I had the chance to go to the other side of the world to meet a piece of heaven. It was a great experience. I did a lot of out of the ordinary activities. I was able to meet very different populations culturally and very welcoming. And of course staying at the hotel either in the pool or under the palm trees on the white sand in front of the turquoise sea is an activity not to be missed. This calm and this nature was wonderful and it was worth the 20 hours of plane trip...  </p>

			<h3>Punta Cana🇩🇴</h3>

				<h3>New-York City 🇺🇸</h3>
				<p> New-York, the city that never sleeps. it is for the moment my favorite destination. it is so big there is so much to see, so many monuments, so many arts, so much party, so much culture, so much fashion... so much life in short. What I liked best was the show in one of the mythical theaters of Broadway that I could see. This trip has a certain cost but it is really worth it, it is a constant show.  </p>
